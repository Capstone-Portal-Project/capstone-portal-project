# Capstone Portal Project

## Notes for the Capstone Team
- `npm run dev` - starts the project in dev mode
- `npm run start` - starts the project in production mode
- `npm run db:push` - pushes updates to the schema (This can temporarily break prod)
- `npm run db:studio` - opens drizzle studio

Watch [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d5x0JCZbAJs&t=6s) to see how the setup was done and get a crash course of how to develop in this environment.

This is a [T3 Stack](https://create.t3.gg/) project bootstrapped with `create-t3-app`.

## What's next? How do I make an app with this?

We try to keep this project as simple as possible, so you can start with just the scaffolding we set up for you, and add additional things later when they become necessary.

If you are not familiar with the different technologies used in this project, please refer to the respective docs. If you still are in the wind, please join our [Discord](https://t3.gg/discord) and ask for help.
